Report Bug \u00b7 Request Feature Adaptive Cards are an open card exchange format enabling developers to exchange UI content in a common and consistent way. Card Authors describe their content as a simple JSON object. That content can then be rendered natively inside a Host Application, automatically adapting to the look and feel of the Host. Goals \u00b6 The goals for Adaptive Cards are: Portable - To any app, device, and UI framework Open - Libraries and schema are open source and shared Low cost - Easy to define, easy to consume
